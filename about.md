# Timeline

Once i had to learn advanced git in a short time, so i made git repository where i commit some important stuff of my life for experiments. Sadly, I can not use 
```bash
git checkout
``` 
in real life, but i can 

```bash
git log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --date=iso --all --date-order
```
to plot this funny tree:
